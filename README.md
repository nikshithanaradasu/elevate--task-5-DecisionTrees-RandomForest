# Task 5: Decision Trees & Random Forests

## ğŸ“Œ Objective:
To build and compare Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on the Heart Disease dataset.

## ğŸ“Š Dataset:
- Used the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- Target column: `target` (1 = has disease, 0 = no disease)

## âœ… Steps Covered:
1. Loaded and explored dataset
2. Cleaned and prepared data
3. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
4. Visualized the tree
5. Trained and evaluated Random Forest
6. Used 5-fold cross-validation
7. Plotted feature importance

## ğŸ“ˆ Results:
- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: ~80%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: ~99%
- Random Forest performed better due to lower overfitting and higher stability.
- Feature importance chart shows the most influential health indicators.

## ğŸ§° Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
